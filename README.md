#Prime pre-study Week 5

##To-Do's
* [x] Your task this week is to clean up this object, making sure all the proper syntax and other needed components are included.
```
avengersMovie = {
    name : Avengers;
    runtime : 143 mins;
    releaseYear = 2012;
    "Director" : "Joss Whedon".
}
```
* [x] Once you have worked through the Object and corrected it, create an html file (index.html) that pulls in the Javascript file (script.js) and console logs out the object.
* [x] Once you have completed that, check the project into GitHub under a repo called 'prime_prestudy_05'.
